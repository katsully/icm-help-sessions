##Week 4

What is an object?</br>
An **object** is a collection of properties, a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

How do arrays works?</br>
Let's say you have an array called *data*.

~~~~
data =  []
data[0] = 698
data [1] = 743
data[2] = 84
~~~~

This creates a structure where at index 0 the value will be 698, index 1 the value will be 743, etc.

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|
|698|743|84 |

#####Degrees and Radians
When talking about units of degrees, most people are more familiar with degrees (0 to 360), but in P5 we use radians. Instead of 0 to 360, in radians, the range is 0 to 2*PI. </br>

Another thing to note is that zero starts at the most right hand point of the circle.
